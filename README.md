# TumblrScraper
Using a random API that I found on the internet I managed to create a scraper for images on Tumblr. Contact me for the API details because I'm not sure of the API's license.

##Usage
I'm still working on it. There's still some filler code, but basically, load up python and make an instance of the class. e.g. `TS('your_favorite_tumblr')`

##Notes
I'm afraid this might trigger some sort of response from the api makers if this gets lots of load. Also, FillQueue isn't up to snuff yet.

##Planned Features
* Single Commands that will trigger an update of all your downloads.
* Edited Exif data for the post date and the URL. This might be relegated to tags?
